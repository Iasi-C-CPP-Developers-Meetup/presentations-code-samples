# Customize Abcd main config directory
  # for your coding style and your projects

1. Recommended at start.
  Read the comments in each Abcd main config file.
  Make changes for all projects in small steps and test each step.

2. Recommended for special projects.
  Add your changes, what is different from the default,
    to each project in its `abcd*.conf`.
  Note that in this way the chosen project settings will remain fixed,
    regardless of the changes in the main onfig files.
  You may what this behavior,
    or you may want a special ARCH for a set of projects.

3. Advanced usage.
  Use a different set of config files, and so different defaults,
    for groups of projects.
  However, with this power comes the responsability to know,
    for each project,
    which is its main configuration and how it is used.

----------------------------------------

Here are some quick examples.

--------------------

Change the language for all projects:
  S_LANG  = "C"   # to use the C language tool chain
  S_LANG  = "CPP" # to use the C++ language tool chain
  S_LANG  = "CPM" # to use the C+- language tool chain

--------------------

Add another compilable language (e.g. GoLang, Rust, Assembler, Java):
  S_LANG  = "NEW_LANG"

For "NEW_LANG" follow these steps:
* Search (case-sensitive, without quotes) in main config files for "CPP".
  * Duplicate to your own language label. In this example "NEW_LANG".
* Adjust as necessary:
  * Compiler & linker flags.
  * Command lines for each tool and each build/test step.
  * Where a command/step is not required, set it to empty string "".
* Search (case-insensitive, without quotes) in main config files
  for "*.cpp" and "*.hpp".
  * Add the patterns used for the source file names.
* Add/Change your language-checker tools in the right hook-script.
* Add/Change your test launcher & report tools in the right hook-script.

Note:
  This name is symbolic. It should have meaning for humans.
  With proper Abcd config, "ASM" can be used for "C++",
    even if it means Assembler for humans.
  It is just a name for Abcd.
  It should be chosen better for the readers.

--------------------

Change the language for one specific project.
* Add to `abcd*.conf`
  S_LANG  = "C"   # to use the C language tool chain

This project will be build with "C" rules,
  regardless of the default value "CPP" or "C".

--------------------

Change the compiler suite for all projects:
  _USE_COMPILER_SUITE = "clang"
  _USE_COMPILER_SUITE = "gcc"

Note:
  This name is symbolic. It should have meaning for humans.
  With proper config, "Lisp" can be used for "C++" compiler & linker,
    even if it means another language for humans.
  It is just a name for Abcd.
  It should be chosen better for the readers.
